# Sentiment-Analyser
## Inspiration
Every company has varied products and services and their sentiment cannot be predicted based on a generalized model. Therefore we create on to fit exactly their needs
## What it does
It trains an AI model based on a predefined database to predict sentiment of data.
## How I built it
It was built on google colab using nltk, sklearn and pandas library
## Challenges I ran into
Optimizing the code for highest accuracy and lowest run time possible
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of creating a project that has potential of development for a real world application
## What I learned
I learned data cleaning and basic AI model development
## What's next for Sentiment Analyzer
It can be made better by effective data cleaning and removal of ineffective stop words
##Content
